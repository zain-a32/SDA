# Low Coupling

**Definition:** Low Coupling is one of the General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (GRASP) that emphasizes reducing dependencies between classes or components in a software system. The goal is to create a modular design where changes in one part of the system have minimal impact on others.

## Key Concepts:

### Independence of Components:
Low coupling encourages designing classes and components that operate independently. This means that each class should have a well-defined responsibility and should not rely heavily on the inner workings of other classes.

### Ease of Maintenance:
When components are loosely coupled, modifications to one component can be made with minimal effects on others. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs during maintenance and enhances the overall maintainability of the system.

### Flexibility and Reusability:
Low coupling increases the flexibility of a system. Classes can be reused in different contexts without being tightly bound to specific implementations. This promotes code reuse and adaptability to changing requirements.

### Encapsulation:
By encapsulating the functionality within classes and exposing only necessary interfaces, low coupling is achieved. This ensures that other components do not need to know the internal details of a class to interact with it.

### Interfacing:
Using interfaces or abstract classes can help achieve low coupling. Classes can interact with each other through these interfaces, allowing for interchangeable implementations without changing the consuming class.

## Benefits:
- **Modular Design:** Systems become more modular, making it easier to understand, develop, and test.
- **Reduced Complexity:** Lower interdependencies lead to reduced complexity in the codebase.
- **Scalability:** Systems designed with low coupling can scale more easily as new features or components can be added with minimal disruption.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Teams can work on different components simultaneously without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes.

## Example:
In a shopping application, if the `ShoppingCart` class directly processes payments, any change to the payment processing logic would require modifying the `ShoppingCart` class. However, by separating the payment processing into a distinct `PaymentProcessor` class, the two can evolve independently, adhering to the low coupling principle.

## Conclusion:
Emphasizing low coupling in software design leads to more robust, maintainable, and flexible systems. It encourages a design philosophy that focuses on separation of concerns, thereby improving the overall architecture and long-term health of software projects.
